# Monitor API activity

Beside implementing prevent security measure, monitoring help to identify potential breaches so as to allow remediation steps to be taken without delay.

As an API provider,  you should also monitor incoming traffic at the resources endpoint for unusual behaviour just like youâ€™d closely monitor any website. Look out for changes in incoming IP address ,  unknown users or unusual traffic spike.
