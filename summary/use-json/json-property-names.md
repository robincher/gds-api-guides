# JSON Property Names

We recommend property names must be **UTF-8** camelC_ase_ and in English

Property names are restricted to **UTF-8** strings. The first character can be a letter, or an underscore, and subsequent characters can be a letter, an underscore, or a number.

Example of a request JSON body

```text
{
    "firstName" : "REST",
    "lastName" : "Service",
    "fullName" : "REST Service",
    "description" : "A REST Service",
    "accountType" : "Savings"
}
```
