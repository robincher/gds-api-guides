# REST API Specification Standard

Use a standard and language-agnostic standards when defining your REST APIs.  [OpenAPI \(OAS\)](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification) is an API specification standard that help design APIs in a machine-readable and human-friendly manners. We **strongly recommend** agencies to adopt this definition standard for their REST API design.

There are a several advantages when adopting an language-agnostic specification

* Ecosystem of 3rd party tools that allow you to generate beautiful and interactive documentations that are user-friendly
* API specification are portable.  You can easily import the definition into tools or API gateways easily.
* With a well-designed API definition, you can ensure quality by testing against every part of your system.  If you are implementing an API Gateway, the gateway could inspect incoming and outgoing traffic to determine whether it conforms with the API specification
