# Date and Time Format

We recommend using the [ISO 8601 standard](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/open-standards-for-government/date-times-and-time-stamps-standard) to represent date and time in the API payload response. This helps people read the time correctly and consistently across WOG.

Use a consistent date format. For dates, this looks like 2018-09-09. For dates and times, use the form **2018-09-09T13:58:07Z.**
