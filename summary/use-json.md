# Use JSON

When designing new web-based digital services, the recommendation for message content type is JSON \(Javascript Object Notation\). JSON is simple, extensible and human readable. Moreover, data represented in JSON format can be easily parsed by a web browser, where most of the application are built upon.

Only consider other message content type when there are requirements to 

* interface with legacy systems that only support a particular format , i.e XML or Cobol.
* design services that strongly tied to a schema, where protocol buffers and XML are better options
